# Neural-Network
This is a project I made for grade 12 CS in July 2018. This is a neural network architecture that uses the backpropogation algorithm for optimization.
I implemented file reading and writing to make it so the weights and biases can be saved and loaded on for later usage.
In the main there is a very simple test for an XOR.

The program is stuctured using layers instead of matrices that function identically. This approach makes it more obvious as to how the data-structure is structured.
